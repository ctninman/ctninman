My life can be broken down into four main, driving passions, with each one remaining an integral part of me as new skills and desires enter. After a childhood dominated by sports, music (I was a classical guitar major in my first iteration) became my second love, followed by fifteen years of caring and dedicated teaching. A switch to online learning due to the pandemic was an empowering time for me, and I was able to use my tech skills to seamlessly navigate to the new format and build websites and educational materials to connect with students remotely, and engage them in self-guided learning. I led workshops to train other teachers how to incorporate EdTech tools in their classrooms, and spent any available moment learning new technologies that could help ignite students' curiosity and imagination. I had found my new driving passion. Now a graduate in Software Engineering from the Flatiron School, I continue to learn new skills and programming languages each day with the goal of continuing to build programs that contribute to society by educating.
